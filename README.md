# 🖥️ **Portfolio Desktop OS**

### *A React-powered personal OS you can play with!*

Ever wished your portfolio felt less like a website and more like a computer you could actually *use*?
Same. So I built one—fully draggable windows, desktop apps, music player, a terminal, and even a pixel editor.

Inspired by **macOS**, styled with **Neo-Brutalism**, sprinkled with ✨ excessive UI love ✨

## 🌈 What is this thing?

This is my personal developer portfolio—but disguised as a **desktop operating system** right inside your browser.

Windows. Dock. Apps. Terminal. Easter eggs.
Yes… it’s *that* extra.
